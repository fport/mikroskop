# ðŸ§Œ What are Micro Frontends
It extends the concepts of micro services to the frontend world. The current trend is to build a feature-rich and powerful browser application, aka single page app, which sits on top of a micro service architecture. Over time the frontend layer, often developed by a separate team, grows and gets more difficult to maintain. Thatâ€™s what we call a Frontend Monolith.
